        <p id="hp">Intro</p>
        <p id="p1"> Ever wanted a phone that satisfies the needs of every type of phone user? Because this is the one. The Redmi Note 9 Pro is a killer handset that thins out the competition in the arena of budget smartphones with all the specs you would need on your smartphone and it comes at a price of 14,499 INR. This is definitely not surprising as almost every phone made by Xiaomi comes in this price tag or lower. But by far, this is the best phone in the market under the budget of 15k.</p>
        <p id="hp">Durabilty</p>
        <p id="p1"> Worried that your phone will get damaged by the family? Do not worry, as this phone has Triple Corning Gorilla Glass5 and is splash resistant!</p>
        <p id="hp">Camera</p>
        <p id="p1"> I am pretty sure there are a lot of people out there who want a phone that has a great front and back camera and most importantly, fit in their budget. This phone has a 
64MP back camera that supports night mode, an 8MP 119o ultra-wide camera, a 16MP selfie camera with which you can get 120 fps slo-mo shots with 1080p resolution and many more. Thatâ€™s already setting the bar really high for the other budget smartphones and we still have more features to talk about!</p>
   <p id="hp">Gaming</p>
   <p id="p1">    There are also some gamers out there who are searching for a phone that is powerful and fits in their budget (Of course they are. I mean, not everyone can afford an ASUS ROG phone 3, can they?) This is definitely nowhere close to less with flagship haptic experience, a giant high-res display, several sensors, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 720G and Expandable storage up to 512GB and a monstrous 5020 mAH battery that provides up to 14 hours of gameplay.</p>
   <p id="hp">Binge-Watching</p>
   <p id="p1">Now for those who love binge-watching. As I said earlier, it has a giant high-res display and a 5020mAH battery. And so this is perfect when you are outside and want to watch some TV series or a Movie.</p>
   <p id="hp">Video/Voice call</p>
   <p id="p1">    Definitely not forgetting the employees with work-from-home and kids with online classes. As I said earlier, a good screen, a big battery that supports 29 hours of VoLTE calling and very loud speakers.</p>
   <p id="hp">Extra</p>
   <p id="p1">    One thing to note is that if you are ready to spend 648 INR more, you can get a screen protector and a pair of earphones. Totally that is 15,147 INR. That is a great deal right! Not to mention the quality of the earphones.</p>
